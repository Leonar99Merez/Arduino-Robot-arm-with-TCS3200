# Arduino-Robot-arm-with-TCS3200
An old project I did 3 years ago
Robot arm controlled by an arduino and a sensor TCS3200.
The motors used in the robot arm were the sg90 servomotors.
The color 1 is the color of pieces I considered defective, so the arm moved  them to the storage one
While color 2 is the color range of pieces I considered as good; the storage 2.
